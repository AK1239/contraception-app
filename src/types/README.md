# Types

This directory contains TypeScript type definitions and interfaces.

## Structure

- `questionnaire.ts` - Medical questionnaire types
- `user.ts` - User profile and preference types
- `api.ts` - API response types (if needed)

- Export types for use throughout the application
- Document complex types with JSDoc comments
- Use union types and enums where appropriate
