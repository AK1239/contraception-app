# Components

This directory contains reusable React Native components used throughout the ContraSafe application.

## Structure

- UI components (buttons, inputs, cards, etc.)
- Compound components (forms, questionnaires, etc.)
- Navigation components
- Custom components specific to contraceptive functionality

## Guidelines

- All components should be TypeScript-enabled
- Components should be documented with PropTypes or interfaces
- Reusable styling should use React Native Paper's theming system
